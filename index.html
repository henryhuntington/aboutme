            <h2>This is a type of table!</h2>
            <p>
                I recently built this table to go next to the stove to increase countertop space in
                our kitchen. It enables many cooking tasks. Since I took this picture, I put it
                where it goes and put hooks under the top surface to hang pots and pans. Soon, I
                will take it out and sand it down some more and maybe treat it with polyurethane.
                We'll see if I have time now that I'm doing coding bootcamp.

            <h2>Tables are really fun to build! Here's how:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>1. Make a sketch that includes the dimensions of the table.</li>
                <li>2. Source the materials. Reclaimed wood is thrifty and can be good looking.</li>
                <li>3. Make appropriate cuts to fit your dimensions.</li>
                <li>
                    4. Assemble the parts without using fasteners (a dry fit) to check for a good
                    measurements.
                </li>
                <li>5. If everything is cut properly, glue and fasten the parts together.</li>
                <li>
                    6. Enjoy your spectacular, functional table and bask in other's appreciation of
                    it.
                </li>
                <li>7. Go to bed already.</li>
            </ol>
